This document proposes an ethos for Texas A&M to expand its use of the International Image Interoperability Framework
(IIIF) as a standard for all of its collections and works. IIIF aligns seamlessly with the philosophy behind the Digital
Assets Management Ecosystem (DAME). While the DAME aims to manage and deliver collections agnostically, irrespective of
the underlying system, IIIF strives to deliver works using interchangeable software, independent of the back-end server.
This flexibility allows for components to be swapped out at any time or for multiple components to run concurrently. [#f1]_
Furthermore, IIIF is designed to allow Libraries to store a resource in a repository and then reuse that resource repeatedly
in other systems. [#f2]_ This not only aligns with the DAME, but provides a key building block to encourage researchers
and other libraries to leverage our resources for use in creative activity and other scholarship.
