Initial Priorities
==================

- Create Guiding Principles for Digital Collections and Vet Broadly
- Create decision tree for DAMS selection
    - When does something go to OakTrust
    - When does something go to Fedora
    - When does something go to OpenONI
    - When does something go to Avalon
    - If something is delivered with something else (Cervantes, IA Bookreader), where are files and works managed
    - Are OpenONI / Avalon files stored directly in those platforms
- Increase accessibility and usability of existing collections
    - Create plan to add closed captioning for existing video collections
    - Create transcripts / audio descriptions for existing audio collections
    - Determine pathway and document how to get transcriptions from From the Page
    - Document existing content models and how IIIF presentation is informed
    - Collaborate with stakeholders and developers to document needs and content models for new works
    - Figure out how ordering of canvases work from both DSPACE and Fedora
        - `Fedora example <https://spotlight.library.tamu.edu/spotlight/london-collection/catalog/d46adeb610031a28bf682e4f68817128>`_
        - `DSPACE <https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/docs/viewer/demo?iiif-content=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.library.tamu.edu%2Fiiif-service%2Fdspace%2Fpresentation%2F1969.1%2F94147>`_
- Increase trust in Digital Collections platforms
    - Make sure all OakTrust links are over HTTPS (are any right now?)
