===================================

Mission
-------

Vision
------

Principles
----------

* Provide equitable access to resources of significant value to the Texas A&M community and beyond
* Enhance and widen access and use of the Library's rare and unique collections
* Promote discoverability and provide context for thoughtfully curated collections
* Respect intellectual property rights
* Understand and address ethical concerns as they arise
    * Create accurate rights statements and apply licenses where appropriate (probably another category)
    * Ensure users have the information they need to use our works responsibly
    * Follow CARE principals
* Promote the use of digital collections in new research and creative activity
* Ensure our initiatives flourish by creating and supporting sustainable solutions

Objectives and Tactics
----------------------

===========================
Expand Discovery and Access
===========================

*Make our unique digital collections discoverable and accessible where our users are*

* Increase discoverability, availability, and accessibility of digital works
    * Develop workflows and create closed captioning files for all video works served to our users.
    * Develop workflows to create transcriptions of handwritten text documents.
    * Develop workflows to create and reuse OCR for typed works.
* Increase visibility and usability of hidden collections
    * Identify "hidden" digital collections that are online but are missing minimal description
    * Develop workflows to automate the generation of minimal descriptive metadata
* Improve discoverability of works and collections in search engines and external services
    * Investigate current SEO of collections are develop plans to improve across digital collections
* Enable interoperability and discovery of assets across collections
    * Develop workflows to to make collections discoverable in VuFind
    * Develop a single discovery interface for works from all digital collections

==============================================================
Optimize Services, Improve Governance, and Strengthen Capacity
==============================================================

*Enhance documentation, microservices, and workflows to increase use and output and meet the needs of our users*

* Continue to adopt open standards to promote interoperability
    * Build applications and microservices using international, open standards (IIIF, OCFL, W3C, etc.)
    * Participate in international standards governance to ensure the needs of the university community are met
* Streamline workflows for import and ingest of new collections
    * Develop decision tree that informs when a particular digital assets management is used
    * Develop application or procedures to automate ingests and free up developer time
    * Improve manifest creation for works from digital assets management systems
* Develop new and improve existing governance framework
    * Create and adopt a new strategic vision for digital collections with a clear mission state, principles, and goals
    * Using the Libraries and Cushing's collection development policy, create a collection development policy for digital collections
    * Create content models that inform how works should be presented in applications
* Acknowledge efforts and give CRediT

==============
Measure Impact
==============

*Understand use and improve the impact of our initiatives*

* Develop program to collect and regularly review usage stats
* Assess user needs and address initiatives appropriately

==========================
Empower Research and Reuse
==========================

*Empower researchers to leverage our collections in their own creative activity*

* Encourage computational use fo digitized and born digital collections
    * Create and make accessible computational datasets for our works and collections
    * Package text and transcripts related to digital collections and works in easily understandable ways
* Develop, provide access to, and support responsible computational use of collections as data
    * Apply accurate rights and licenses based on RightsStatements.org, Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, and Traditional Knowledge Notices
    * Consider and develop adequate safeguards against improper usage, detrimental loss of context, and the amplification of biases in Artificial Intelligence
* Identify stakeholders and understand needs
    * Reduce barriers to use
* Lower barriers to use and reuse of collections
    * Create and share documentation on how to access collections as data
    * Publicize Open APIs and other pathways that enable reuse
    * Provide public access to governing documentation to increase understandability (Metadata, Governance, everything)

Things to Include / Consider Including
--------------------------------------

* Mission
* Vision
* Principles
* Objectives
* Workflows, policies, and practices for recommendation, identification, selection, acquisition, description, processing, preservation, and access of born digital content for the Library’s collection
* Further development of the Library’s technical infrastructure to support the full digital content lifecycle
* Development of various access policies and procedures appropriate to different categories of digital content
* Training and development of staff
* Align with strategies at Cushing, the Libraries, and the greater campus community
