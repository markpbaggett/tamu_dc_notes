Digital Collections Strategy
============================

Mission
-------

Vision
------

Principles
----------

* Understand and address ethical concerns
    * Create accurate rights statements and apply licenses where appropriate (probably another category)
    * Ensure users have the information they need to use our works responsibly
    * Follow CARE principals

Objectives and Tactics
----------------------

===========================
Expand Discovery and Access
===========================

*Make our unique digital collections discoverable and accessible where our users are*

* Increase discoverability, availability, and accessibility of digital works
    * Develop workflows and create closed captioning files for all video works served to our users.
    * Develop workflows to create transcriptions of handwritten text documents.
    * Develop workflows to create and reuse OCR for typed works.
* Increase visibility and usability of hidden collections
    * Identify "hidden" digital collections that are online but are missing minimal description
    * Develop workflows to automate the generation of minimal descriptive metadata
* Improve discoverability of works and collections in search engines and external services
    * Investigate current SEO of collections are develop plans to improve across digital collections
* Create interoperability and discovery of assets across collections
    * Develop workflows to to make collections discoverable in VuFind
    * Develop a single discovery interface for works from all digital collections

==============================================================
Optimize Services, Improve Governance, and Strengthen Capacity
==============================================================

*Enhance documentation, microservices, and workflows to increase use and output*

* Enhance digital services and infrastructure to meet the needs of researchers and students at Texas A&M and beyond (drop)
* Streamline workflows for import and ingest of new collections
* Improve manifest creation for works from digital assets management systems
* Acknowledge efforts and give CRediT

==============
Measure Impact
==============

*Understand use and improve the impact of our initiatives*

* Develop program to collect and regularly review usage stats
* Assess user needs and address initiatives appropriately

==========================
Empower Research and Reuse
==========================

*Empower researchers to leverage our collections in their own creative activity*

* Create and make accessible computational datasets for our works and collections
    * Package text and transcripts related to digital collections so that they are easily usable by researchers
* Develop, provide access to, and support responsible computational use of collections as data
    * Apply accurate rights and licenses based on RightsStatements.org, Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, and Traditional Knowledge Notices
    * Consider and develop adequate safeguards against improper usage, detrimental loss of context, and the amplification of biases in Artificial Intelligence
* Identify stakeholders and understand needs
    * Reduce barriers to use
* Make users aware of pathways to reuse
    * Create and share documentation on how to access collections as data
    * Publicize Open APIs and other pathways that enable reuse
    * Provide public access to governing documentation to increase understandability (Metadata, Governance, everything)

Things to Include / Consider Including
