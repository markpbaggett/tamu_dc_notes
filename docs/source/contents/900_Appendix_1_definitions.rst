Appendix 1: Definitions
=======================

A
-

**Archival File (Archival Master)**: As defined by FADGI, the highest quality version of a digital file, intended to
serve as a long-term preservation copy. It is typically uncompressed or minimally compressed to ensure the highest
fidelity to the original source and is not usually used for routine access but is preserved to ensure the long-term
preservation of the digital object. These files are commonly saved in formats that are widely recognized for their
stability and suitability for long-term preservation, such as TIFF for images or WAV for audio files. They are also
stored in a secure, managed environment with proper metadata to support its longevity. This is a similar idea to
the :code:`pcdmuse:IntermediateFile`.

C
-

**Collections as Data**: the concept of treating library collections not just as static items to be catalogued and
stored, but as dynamic datasets that can be analyzed, manipulated, and used for research with computational methods.
The term is derived from "The Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data" [#f1]_ and the earlier "Collections as Data:
Stewardship and Use Models to Enhance Access" [#f2]_.

E
-

**Exhibit**: Exhibits provide libraries, archives, and museums a mechanism to add meaningful context and significance
beyond descriptive metadata to works from large collections or aggregated from disparate software or institutions.
Exhibits can be organized topically from multiple collections or smaller selections from large collections. In adding
context, the exhibit provides an additional access point to the greater digital collection.

**Intermediate File**: According to the `Portland Common Data Model Use Extension <https://pcdm.org/2021/04/09/use>`_,
intermediate files are high quality representations of an object, appropriate for generating derivatives or other
additional processing.

P
-

**Production File (Production Master)**: As defined by FADGI, a high-quality version of a digital file, intended for use in creating access
copies or for further production work. While still high quality, it may undergo some level of processing or compression
compared to the archival file (master) to facilitate ease of use and distribution. It is used as a source for generating
various derivatives, such as access copies for online viewing or lower resolution versions for different applications.
Formats can vary depending on the intended use but often are more accessible and practical for production purpose and
are stored with care and proper metadata, but may be accessed more frequently than the archival file (master). This is
a similar idea to :code:`pcdmuse:IntermediateFile`.

W
-

**Work**: According to the `Portland Common Data Model Works Extension <https://pcdm.org/2021/04/09/works>`_, an
intellectual entity, such as a book, film, dissertation, etc. Works have member Objects representing their physical
structure (e.g., pages in a book), FileSets to maintain representations of the entire resource (e.g. a PDF of all the
pages), and TopRanges representing their logical structure or structures (e.g., sections and chapters in a book).
