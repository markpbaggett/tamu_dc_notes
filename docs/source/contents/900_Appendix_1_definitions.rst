**Collections as Data**: the concept of treating library collections not just as static items to be catalogued and
stored, but as dynamic datasets that can be analyzed, manipulated, and used for research with computational methods.
The term is derived from "The Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data" [#f1]_ and the earlier "Collections as Data:
Stewardship and Use Models to Enhance Access" [#f2]_.

**Exhibit**: Exhibits provide libraries, archives, and museums a mechanism to add meaningful context and significance
beyond descriptive metadata to works from large collections or aggregated from disparate software or institutions.
Exhibits can be organized topically from multiple collections or smaller selections from large collections. In adding
context, the exhibit provides an additional access point to the greater digital collection.

**Work**: According to the `Portland Common Data Model Works Extension <https://pcdm.org/2021/04/09/works>`_, an
intellectual entity, such as a book, film, dissertation, etc. Works have member Objects representing their physical
structure (e.g., pages in a book), FileSets to maintain representations of the entire resource (e.g. a PDF of all the
pages), and TopRanges representing their logical structure or structures (e.g., sections and chapters in a book).
